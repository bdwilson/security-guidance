# Security Mentor Notes

## Do your research
There are many different areas of cybersecurity – build it, break it, protect it, audit it, assess it? With a variety of paths to choose, take time to research what you want to do. Having an idea of which directions pique your interest will help prioritize which areas you want to explore first and determine the right fit for you.  You don’t necessarily have to be a computer science graduate to get into cybersecurity – the space is quickly changing to the point where AI, data scientists and those with analytical backgrounds can quickly find themselves helping teams understand the best ways to tackle security challenges. 

My first advice would be to review the [Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) Workforce Development](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development) content. They have recognized the talent shortage and have a federal inititive to help change that. Their site has an abundance of resources from a career pathways tool to help you see the different roles in each area, to education and training opportunities. I would start here to see if it can help uncover an area that interests you. In addition to their [career pathways tool](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/cyber-career-pathways-tool), [this guide](https://cybersecurityguide.org/careers/) can give you an idea of the various roles you might want to focus on, while [this information from Edx](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/cybersecurity?linked_from=sitenav) gives you an idea of what an entry-level analyst would do.

Another avenue for many is to get on the ground level of an org as an Information Technology help desk/sys admin to learn the ropes & the environment. Every org has their own nuances and lingo, this is a good way to familiarize yourself with that. These roles often have an easier time transitioning into a security role at the company once they understand the business and IT pieces better. If not joining a company to get IT experience, [Bootcamps](#bootcamps) may be right for you, but keep reading to make sure you review your free/cost-effective options. As you do your research and look for training content keep in mind that <b>___often students and current/past military service members may be eligible for discounts for various training, courses or bootcamps___</b>, so always ASK.  

## Stay Up-to-date
Staying up-to-date on cybersecurity happenings is a requirement, no matter if you're a practitioner or an security leader.  Below are a few areas that can help keep you up-to-date.

### Social Media
The cybersecurity community is very social on Twitter and Reddit (/r/cybersecurity, /r/netsec, /r/netsecstudents). In fact, /r/cybersecurity still runs a “Mentorship Monday,” where prospective security pros can ask questions or seek advice. Twitter was also a great place to get up-to-the-minute information about breaking cybersecurity news and a forum where many researchers post and discuss new vulnerability and security disclosures. Honestly, https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity has a great perspective on Security, has a ton of followers and moved from help desk to security admin. He’s always involved in the community. __Update__: Given that infosec engagement on Twitter and Reddit have declined significantly due to organizational issues at each company, it can be hard to find good cybersecurity professionals to engage with. Many have moved to Mastadon and rekindled their LinkedIn page, so I would seek out both of those to expand your network. No admirable security professional would intentionally turn away an invitation from a prospective student or individual looking for career advice. Make your request genuine so that they know you want to connect and expand your network. 

### Websites
As far as other good content that have good security content to stay up-to-date on technology.

* https://theintercept.com/technology/
* https://www.wired.com/category/security/

### Podcasts
Here are podcasts that I try to stay up-to-date on, but often times I need a break from security and. YMMV and you may need to skip through some sections of each of these. 
* https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/ - Jack is a great storyteller and all of his stories are fantastic. 
* https://therecord.media/podcast - If you listened to NPR, then you know Dina Temple-Raston. 
* https://www.scmagazine.com/security-weekly - I grew up listening to Paul Asadoorian when it was Pauldotcom. There is content you'll have to skip through, but the knowledge of most of his hosts and guests are top-tier.  
* CISO Series - these are all good if you're a security leader, or want to know what decisions security leaders must deal with. 
  * https://cisoseries.com/category/podcast/cyber-security-headlines/
  * https://cisoseries.com/category/podcast/ciso-series-podcast/
  * https://cisoseries.com/category/podcast/defense-in-depth/
* https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xtvg9/episodes/downloads - Great series covering the Lazarus Group and Wannacry ransomware.  

## Attend security events, grow your network. 
COVID pushed many security conferences to virtual (and made many free), so make sure you explore what conferences are available. Keep in mind that many have discounts for students. For example, [Holiday Hack Challenge and KringleCon](https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge/), an annual conference and online challenge sponsored by SANS, is a great way to meet people and learn about new security threats. Can’t dedicate time to a structured conference? Many security professionals publish their findings and talks on YouTube - search for a topic or conference you're interested in to find the recordings. [Blackhills Infosec](https://wildwesthackinfest.com/) has a conference that is well attended and has made their [talks available](https://www.youtube.com/c/WildWestHackinFest). [Defcon](https://defcon.org) also has an annual conference with recordings available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference). You should also look at local organizations and meetups, many of which can be found via your local ISSA chapter or by searching on [Meetup.com](https://meetup.com) or [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com) for security topics in your area. 

## Get Trained
Many security consultancy firms leverage their expertise to help grow the career of other infosec professionals and offer “pay what you can” training (or at least signficantly discounted). Some of the companies doing this: [SecureIdeas](https://training.secureideas.com/), [BlackHills Information Security/Antisyphon](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/), [TCM Training](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/). There are much larger organizations, like SANS that has great training opportunities, but the pricing is not advantagous to pay on your own if you're early in your career or want to test the waters. SANS has also discontinued their free training, but have linked to some [free](https://www.sans.org/cyberaces/) resources. 

### Online Courses 
Both Coursera and EduX have several options which are available for free (to audit). I have not taken these or received feedback on any of these, so if you do take these, please provide me feedback so I can share. I also found a [list of courses](https://builtin.com/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-training) available from BuiltIn. Don't forget to look for discounts! 

* https://www.coursera.org/specializations/it-fundamentals-cybersecurity 
* https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity-essentials
* https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-cybersecurity-cyber-attacks
* https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-cybersecurity-3
* https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-cybersecurity

If you take a course, even a free one, make sure you keep track of your hours spent, curriculum learned, and how you applied what you learned (see [Test Your Skills](#Test_Your_Skills) below). This may help contribute to hands-on work that you can put on your resume, at a minumum you can list the courses and hours completed on your resume.

### Bootcamps
Many colleges have recognized the talent gap in cybersecurity and are using this as an opportunity to bring in professional cybersecurity leaders to develop and teach content at a collegiate level. The purpose is to cover the topic, soup to nuts, and is often intended for those who have no previous IT experience.  You'll need to review the programs to detemrine how your current skillset aligns with the course work to determine if this is the right approach for you. Most of the bootcamps I've seen include hands-on lab exercises so that the content taught can be used in practice. This would certainly be resume-worthy if a certification is gained, however keep in mind that these programs are fairly expensive ($15k-$30k), but there may be opportunities for scholarships or financal options. Look for courses taught by accredited schools.

## Test your skills
There is a ton of free resources on the Internet and a robust community of people dedicated to curating them. One example is [here](https://github.com/vitalysim/Awesome-Hacking-Resources). You can also find several reasonable penetration testing lab websites to virtually test your skills to see if you have what it takes in different security arenas. HackTheBox and TryHackMe are two online providers you can read about [here](https://defaultcredentials.com/ctf/tryhackme-vs-hackthebox-cybersecurity-training/) and both offer free tiers for you to do hands-on hacking. There is certainly an expectation that you need at least general IT skills to start, even with the basic levels, so ensuring you have a good technology foundation. For High School and College-aged folks, the [US Cyber Challenge](https://www.uscyberchallenge.org/) is a good option to test your skills and get hired by the government. 

# Interview/Resume Tips
* For new career cybersecurity individuals who lack direct cybersecurity experience but have past business experience, highlight your qualities that made you successful in your past career. Soft skills matter in this industry, so talk about collaboration, organization, delegation, leadership, critical thinking, etc. I would prefer to train someone on the security technologies we are using then to have to train them on soft skills.  You can always relate past projects and how you organized your thoughts to any situation that an interviewer throws at you. 
* If you lack work experience in an area, make up for it by taking a course and referencing it on your resume. It may trigger a question where you can walk through the scenario and explain how you used it. You may have to use technology buzzwords to get it noticed, so be prepared to reset the scope of the conversation and explain how it is relevant to the job you’re applying for.
* If you don't know the answer, admit it, but be prepared to talk about how you'd tackle figuring it out.
* There are SO many free training resources out there for learning cyber-related topics, you must be able to demonstrate practical knowledge gained to prove you are passionate about the space. You need to be engaged in the community, be aware of current events and mainstream cyber topics and be able to relate those events back to how you'd handle them if you were making the decisions.
* Have someone else review your resume AND ask a peer what they feel like your best qualities are. You are you own worst enemy, and imposter syndrome is rampant in cybersecurity. Don’t be afraid to solicit feedback from others because those qualities can help you sell yourself.
