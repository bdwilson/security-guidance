# Security Mentor Notes

## Do your research
There are many different areas of cybersecurity – build it, break it, protect it? With a variety of paths to choose, take time to research what you want to do. Having an idea of which directions pique your interest will help prioritize which areas you want to explore first and determine the right fit for you.  You don’t necessarily have to be a computer science graduate to get into cyber security – the space is quickly changing to the point where data scientists and those with analytical backgrounds can quickly find themselves helping teams understand the best ways to tackle security hurdles. Haven’t decided yet? May make sense to get in on the ground level of an org as a help desk/sys admin to learn the ropes & the environment.  Every org has their own nuances and lingo, this is a good way to familiarize yourself with that. [This guide](https://cybersecurityguide.org/careers/) can give you an idea of the various roles you might want to focus on.

## Stay Up-to-date
The cybersecurity community is very social on Twitter and Reddit (/r/cybersecurity, /r/netsec, /r/netsecstudents). In fact, /r/cybersecurity recently started a “Mentorship Monday,” where prospective security pros can ask questions or seek advice. Twitter is also a great place to get up-to-the-minute information about breaking cybersecurity news and a forum where many researchers post and discuss new vulnerability and security disclosures. Honestly, https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity has a great perspective on Security, has a ton of followers and moved from help desk to security admin. He’s always involved in the community.

## Attend security events 
COVID has also pushed many security conferences to virtual (and many are free), so make sure you explore what conferences are available. Keep in mind that many have discounts for students. For example, [Holiday Hack Challenge and KringleCon](https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge/), an annual conference and online challenge sponsored by SANS, is a great way to meet people and learn about new security threats. Can’t dedicate time to a structured conference? Many security professionals publish their findings and talks on YouTube - search for a topic or conference you're interested in to find the recordings. [Blackhills Infosec](https://wildwesthackinfest.com/) has a conference that is well attended and has made their [talks available](https://www.youtube.com/c/WildWestHackinFest). [Defcon](https://defcon.org] also has an annual conference with recordings available.
