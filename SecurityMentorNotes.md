# Security Mentor Notes

## Do your research
There are many different areas of cybersecurity – build it, break it, protect it? With a variety of paths to choose, take time to research what you want to do. Having an idea of which directions pique your interest will help prioritize which areas you want to explore first and determine the right fit for you.  You don’t necessarily have to be a computer science graduate to get into cyber security – the space is quickly changing to the point where data scientists and those with analytical backgrounds can quickly find themselves helping teams understand the best ways to tackle security hurdles. Haven’t decided yet? May make sense to get in on the ground level of an org as a help desk/sys admin to learn the ropes & the environment.  Every org has their own nuances and lingo, this is a good way to familiarize yourself with that. [This guide](https://cybersecurityguide.org/careers/) can give you an idea of the various roles you might want to focus on.

## Stay Up-to-date
The cybersecurity community is very social on Twitter and Reddit (/r/cybersecurity, /r/netsec, /r/netsecstudents). In fact, /r/cybersecurity recently started a “Mentorship Monday,” where prospective security pros can ask questions or seek advice. Twitter is also a great place to get up-to-the-minute information about breaking cybersecurity news and a forum where many researchers post and discuss new vulnerability and security disclosures. Honestly, https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity has a great perspective on Security, has a ton of followers and moved from help desk to security admin. He’s always involved in the community.

## Attend security events, grow your network. 
COVID has also pushed many security conferences to virtual (and many are free), so make sure you explore what conferences are available. Keep in mind that many have discounts for students. For example, [Holiday Hack Challenge and KringleCon](https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge/), an annual conference and online challenge sponsored by SANS, is a great way to meet people and learn about new security threats. Can’t dedicate time to a structured conference? Many security professionals publish their findings and talks on YouTube - search for a topic or conference you're interested in to find the recordings. [Blackhills Infosec](https://wildwesthackinfest.com/) has a conference that is well attended and has made their [talks available](https://www.youtube.com/c/WildWestHackinFest). [Defcon](https://defcon.org) also has an annual conference with recordings available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference). You should also look at local organizations and meetups, many of which can be found via your local ISSA chapter or by searching on [Meetup.com](https://meetup.com) or [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com) for security topics in your area. 

## Get Trained
Many security companies cater to those who are starting their infosec career and offer “pay what you can” training. Some of the companies doing this: [SecureIdeas](https://training.secureideas.com/), [BlackHills Information Security/Antisyphon](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/), [TCM Training](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/). There are much larger organizations, like SANS that has great training opportunities, but the pricing is not advantagous to pay on your own if you're early in your career or want to test the waters.  

## Test your skills
There is a ton of free hacking resources on the Internet and a robust community of people dedicated to curating them one example is [here](https://github.com/vitalysim/Awesome-Hacking-Resources). You can also find several reasonable penetration testing lab websites to virtually test your skills to see if you have what it takes in different security arenas. HackTheBox and TryHackMe are two you can read about [here](https://defaultcredentials.com/ctf/tryhackme-vs-hackthebox-cybersecurity-training/). For High School and College-aged folks, the [US Cyber Challenge](https://www.uscyberchallenge.org/) is a good option to test your skills and get hired by the government. 


# Interview/Resume Tips
* For new career infosec individuals who lack infosec experience but have past business experience, highlight your qualities that made you successful in your past career. The soft skills matter in this industry, so talk about collaboration, organization, delegation, leadership, critical thinking, etc.  I would prefer to train someone on the security technologies we are using than to have to train them up on soft skills.  You can always relate past projects and how you organized your thoughts to any situation that an interviewer throws at you. 
* If you lack work experience in an area, make up for it by taking a course and referencing it on your resume. It may trigger a question where you can walk through the scenario and explain how you used it. You may have to use technology buzzwords to get it noticed, so be prepared to reset the scope of the conversation and explain how it is relevant to the job you’re applying for.
* Have someone else review your resume AND ask a peer what they feel like your best qualities are. You are you own worst enemy, and imposter syndrome is rampant in infosec. Don’t be afraid to solicit feedback from others because those qualities can help you sell yourself.
