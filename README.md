# Device & Account Security Checklist

AKA: Security for the rest of us. 

The goal of this checklist is to help regular people figure out what they need
to do in order to secure their digital life. **Regular** people being those who
don't live, breathe and fully grasp security concepts but know they need to do more to
protect themselves and their families from cyber threats. We have added some more **advanced** 
options for people who want even more control, however those have disclaimers at the beginning of each section. 

If you are in the information security field or have other responsiblities that might
increase your cyber risks (wealth, popular, social media influencer, etc) then
you likely want to go beyond what this document can offer in terms of advice.

# Contributions & Corrections 
If you have corrections that pertain to **regular** people or any
formatting/gramatical errors, please let me know via an issue or fork the document and issue
pull requests to fix. Keep in mind regular likely don't need VPN's because TLS is so
pervasive, hence why that is not included.

for his work on the Device and Account Security checklist that he put together
for the DNC that this is based off of. I started with this as a template and
have adapated it as others ask me the best way to do things.
