# Cybersecurity Guidance 

## Device & Account Security Checklist 
The goal of this checklist is to help regular people figure out what they need
to do in order to secure their digital life. **Regular** people being those who
don't live, breathe and fully grasp security concepts but know they need to do more to
protect themselves and their families from cyber threats. We have added some more **advanced** 
options for people who want even more control, however those have disclaimers at the beginning of each section. 

If you are in the information security field or have other responsiblities that might
increase your cyber risks (wealth, popular, social media influencer, etc) then
you likely want to go beyond what this document can offer in terms of advice.
