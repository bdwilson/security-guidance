# Device & Account Security Checklist

The goal of this checklist is to help regular people figure out what they need
to do in order to secure their digital life. **Regular** people being those who
don't live, breathe and fully grasp security but know they need to do more to
protect themselves and their families.  

If you are in the information security field or have other things that might
increase the risks to you (wealth, popular, social media influencer, etc) then
you likely want to go beyond what this document can offer in terms of advice. 

If you have corrections that pertain to **regular** people or any
formatting/gramatical errors, please let me know or fork the document and issue
pull requests to fix. Regular people don't need VPN's because TLS is so
pervasive, hence why that is not included.

for his work on the Device and Account Security checklist that he put together
for the DNC that this is based off of. I started with this as a template and
have adapated it as others ask me the best way to do things.
