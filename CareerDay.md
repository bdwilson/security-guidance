# A Career in Cybersecurity

## What is Cybersecurity?
* Cybersecurity is the act of protecting information on the Internet.
* Crimes happen in real life – such as stealing – the same activities happen on the Internet.  
* Examples of information that a Cybersecurity professional might protect:
   * Personal Information (your grades, name, address, phone number, passwords)
   * Health Information (your medicines, allergies, illnesses)
   * Financial Information (credit card, banking account, vbucks)
   * Intellectual Property (Recipe for Coca Cola, Fortnite source code)

## What would make me a good candidate for a career in Cybersecurity?
* Are you interested in technology? 
* Are you a problem solver?  Do you want to know why something happened?
* Are you naturally curious and want to learn how things work?
* Are you good at communicating and explaining technical things to others?
* Do you like to learn? Cybersecurity challenges change daily, so there is always a new threat or technique to learn. 

## Why choose Cybersecurity?
* There is a global shortage of Cybersecurity talent (400k open cyber positions in the US in 2021).
* Pay is competitive. Starting salaries are around $60k/yr. Average salary is $120k/yr.
* Many colleges have degrees focused on Cybersecurity.
* Much of the work can be done remotely/from home.

## What can I do to protect myself online?

* Keep personal information private – address, phone number, name, birthday, passwords.
   * Ensure social networking privacy settings limit what others can see about you.
   * Do not use the same passwords across different Internet sites.
* Think twice before you post or say anything online. 
* Treat others as you want to be treated.
* Don’t answer calls or text messages from anyone you don’t trust.
* Speak up if you see something inappropriate or suspicious. Tell an adult you trust. 
* Don’t fall for advertisements or unsolicited emails offering something that seems too good to be true.
